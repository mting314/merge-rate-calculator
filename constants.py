# list all disposition variable names (Most of these cities have an incident report listed for every call, which makes the incident report variables somewhat useless.  Only three cities have incident report variables that are only populated if the dispatch results in an incident report, so for Stockton, Tucson, and Virginia Beach, instead of listing the disposition variable name, I listed the incident report variable name.)
